Components of a DBMS (Database Management System)
1.	DBMS Engine: 
2.	Database Schema: 
3.	Query Processor: 
4.	Database Manager.
5.	Data Dictionary
6.	Transaction Management:.
7.	Storage ManagerRelational Database
A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables (relations) and allows for relationships between these tables. Data in relational databases is organized into rows (records) and columns (attributes).
Examples of relational databases:
1.	MySQL –.
2.	PostgreSQL 
3.	Oracle Database.
4.	Microsoft SQL Server.
Classifications of SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) can be classified into three main types:
1.	DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used for manipulating data in the database. It includes operations such as:
o	SELECT 
o	INSERT 
o	UPDATE 
o	DELETE
2.	DDL (Data Definition Language): Deals with the structure of the database and defines database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas. It includes:
o	CREATE 
o	ALTER 
o	DROP 
3.	DCL (Data Control Language): Used for controlling access to the data in the database, particularly managing user privileges. It includes:
o	GRANT 
o	REVOKE 
Primary Key vs. Foreign Key
•	Primary Key:
o	A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and cannot contain NULL values.
o	Example: In a table of "Employees," the employee ID could be a primary key.
•	Foreign Key:
o	A foreign key is a field (or a collection of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in the two tables.
o	Example: In an "Orders" table, the customer ID could be a foreign key that refers to the primary key in the "Customers" table.
Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the entities in a database and their relationships. It is used to model the structure of the database by showing entities (like tables) and the relationships between them. An ERD typically includes:
•	Entities: 
•	Relationships: 
•	AttributesAdvantages of Relational Databases
1.	Data Integrity
2.	Flexibility: 
3.	Scalability.
4.	Security:.
Four Types of Data Types in Tables
1.	INT
2.	VARCHAR
3.	DATE: 
4.	DECIMAL.
Purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS)
•	Data Storage: 
•	Data Retrieval: 
•	Data Security: 
•	Data Integrity: 
•	Data Backup and Recovery
